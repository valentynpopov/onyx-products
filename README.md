Here is the list of improvements I would implement in a production-quality system:
- Use separate DTOs for the public API and the database
- Add exception handling; display errors details in Dev environment
- Add logging
- Use Polly to retry db operations
- Add integration tests for the API as a whole, not just for controllers and the repository
- Use a proper database engine like SQL Server, rather than SQLite
